## Getting Started

First, clone the repo (Don't forget to change the name!)
```bash
# Clone Repo but add your own folder name
git clone git@github.com:nrthbound/sveltekit-base.git your-app-name

cd your-app-name
```

## Change Git Remote
Don't forget to change the remote to your own repo (if you didn't fork my version).

```bash
# Remove Origin
git remote rm origin

# Set your own
git remote add origin https://github.com/[user]/[repo].git
```

> Note: It's easier to fork my repo and continue on from there.

## Developing
```bash
# If you're not in the working directory
cd your-app-name

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build for Production
```bash
npm run prod
```
